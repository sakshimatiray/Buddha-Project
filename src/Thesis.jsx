//       <p>Buddhism is an amazing philosophy full of wisdom with great truths, however I believe Buddhists have lost the way of the Buddha and lack a real basis of impact. Effective Buddhism is a solution to those who seek to follow the Buddhist Path as Buddha Wanted. If Buddha was alive today, imagine the amount of change and impact he would be having.</p>
