        <h1>Evidence:</h1>
        <p>In current Buddhist society, the top Buddhist role models have iron wills, but lack real ACTION or PURPOSE behind this because of a misinterpretation of Dharma. Buddha’s four main vows tell a different story of how the Buddha should act.</p>
      <h3>   The Bodhisattva Vows exist in many different forms; they are chanted as follows:</h3>
      <h5>  1.Creations are numberless, I vow to free them.
     <br/>  2. Delusions are inexhaustible, I vow to transform them.
     <br/>  3. Reality is boundless, I vow to perceive it
     <br/>  4. The awakened way is unsurpassable, I vow to embody it.
</h5>
<h3>It’s also said in this way.</h3>
<h5>
<br/> 1. Living beings are limitless, I vow to liberate them all.

 <br/>2. Blind passions are limitless, I vow to sever them all.

 <br/>3. Dharma gates are inexhaustible, I vow to know them all.

 <br/>4. Unsurpassed is awakening, I vow to realize it.
</h5>
<h3>Or, in the most laymen terms:</h3>
<h5> 1. To save all people

<br/> 2. To renounce all worldly desires

<br/>3. To learn all teachings

<br/> 4. To attain perfect enlightenment</h5>
